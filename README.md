# This is hylohubot.

Whenever the robot enters a room it will send a random message to let you know it knows you are there.

Write `hi` or `hello`, to hear the bot responding back to you (a message plus a picture).

If you intriduce yourself to the bot, it would tell you how happy it is to meet you
> My name is Sahar
> It is nice to meet you Sahar

You can tell the bot how the weather is, like `It is cold` or `It is rainy` and the bot will tell you if there is anything
that you should make sure to have with you, or it will wish you a good day.

Say "Ship it" to get a random image.
Say "open the (blank) doors" and get a reply depending on whether (blank) is "pod bay" or something else.
